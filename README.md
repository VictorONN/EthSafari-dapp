# ETH TWAP Project

This project demonstrates a basic ETH TWAP strategy by making purchases on Uniswap at a predetermined time interval. Users make deposits before a certain deadline, the admin then makes purchases every day in the runup to an event.
Initially, the idea was to have this contract as a fun strategy for a group of friends who want to come together and TWAP Ethereum daily after a deadline in the runup to the Merge.

// Unfinished - there is still some work to do on the frontend.
